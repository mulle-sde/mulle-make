ðŸ¤– Build projects uniformly with a variety of build systems

![Last version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/mulle-sde/mulle-make.svg)

... for Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, Windows

**mulle-make** will determine if the project needs to
be build via `configure`, `autoconf`, `cmake` or some other build tool.
It will then proceed to build the project using that tool.
